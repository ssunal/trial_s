# trials
to whom it may concern,
I coded some tasks. I couldn't complete all tasks because I didn't get any email about my questions.
the system allows you;
* to fill all data from API.
* update any property
* delete any property
* see all updated property and browse with page buttons. (first,last,previous,next pages)
If you want to see all programs. You can visit http://http://185.122.57.199/yen
if you want reload all data from API, you can visit http://185.122.57.199/yenFill
Thank you.
Kind regards.
